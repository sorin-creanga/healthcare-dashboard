| `Time to Triage (min)`               | Time taken for triage assessment.                                     |
| `Time to Medical Professional (min)` | Time taken to see a doctor or healthcare professional.                |
| `Total Wait Time (min)`              | Total time from arrival to seeing a medical professional.             |
| `Patient Outcome`                    | Outcome of the visit (Admitted, Discharged, Left Without Being Seen). |
| `Patient Satisfaction`               | Satisfaction score (1 to 5, with 5 being the highest).                |

## Key Insights

- **Nurse-to-Patient Ratios**: Lower ratios (e.g., 1:2) improve efficiency, leading to shorter wait times, while higher ratios (e.g., 1:5) correlate with longer delays.
- **Patient Outcomes and Urgency**: Critical cases are prioritized, resulting in shorter wait times and higher satisfaction scores, while non-urgent cases experience longer delays.
- **Peak Hours**: High patient volumes during afternoons and evenings.
- **Busiest Day**: Mondays experience the highest traffic due to post-weekend visits.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Winter sees increased visits (e.g., flu season), while summer sees heat-related conditions.
- **Regional Differences**: Urban hospitals have more specialists and larger facilities, leading to shorter wait times for critical cases.

## How the Dataset Was Created

This dataset was generated using a Python script designed to simulate realistic emergency room scenarios. Key steps include:

- **Domain Research**: Insights from healthcare reports and studies were used to design logical relationships between variables (e.g., urgency levels, wait times, and satisfaction scores).
- **Simulated Logic**: Factors such as time of day, season, weekday, and urgency level were weighted to reflect real-world trends.
- **Random Variability**: Noise was introduced to add realism and prevent overly deterministic patterns.
- **Data Generation**: 5,000 records were created, with unique patient and visit identifiers, and exported to CSV format.

### Role of ChatGPT in Dataset Creation

ChatGPT was instrumental in designing the logic for this dataset. It:

- Provided recommendations on domain-specific patterns to include (e.g., seasonal and time-based trends).
- Assisted in refining assumptions for variables like wait times, satisfaction, and nurse-to-patient ratios.


## Usage

This dataset is ideal for:

- Building dashboards (e.g., Power BI, Tableau).
- Learning data analysis techniques.
- Testing statistical models for healthcare operations.

## Limitations

- Simulated data: While based on real-world patterns, it does not represent actual patient data.
- Variability: Assumptions and randomness introduce noise for educational realism.

## Sources and Inspiration

This dataset leverages domain insights from:

- Healthcare industry reports.
- Research on emergency room dynamics.
- Statistical summaries of ER performance metrics.
